## Usage

Each script exports an async `main` function, that needs to be awaited:
```js
const { main: scriptName } = require('./scripts/<scriptName>.js');

const output = await main();
// OR, as a promise:
main().then(output => ...);
```

Scripts can be tested by adding them to the `runner.js` file, and running it with `node runner.js`.
Script execution can be stopped by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.
